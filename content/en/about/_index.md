## Some words to 10043er if you are being restricted or are about to apply abroad

The USA sanctions on 10043 have evolved to troublesome study visa check with more than half of a year - Canada's security check, the UK's ATAS review, Australia's research-based master's and doctoral review, European countries restrictions like Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Belgium. The figure shows the rejection letter I received from a French university on the second day of President Macron's friendly visit to China in 2023.

Although the world situation is changing rapidly, although politics seems to be far away from us, and although we feel its earthquake firsthand, please stick to being yourself. The international relationship between contries will not be changed just by our thoughts. The dust of the times is like a mountain when it falls on a person. I have experienced helplessness and despair like you. After recalling, I think it was a experience for grow up to participate in a global event. Just to be what you want to be is okay because capability and life lessons are your own things. Lastly, Wish you a bright future.
